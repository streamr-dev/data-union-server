# Streamr Data Union server

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/streamr-dev/data-union-server.svg?token=9unddqKugX2cPcyhtVxp&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/streamr-dev/data-union-server)

# Running

`node scripts/start_server.js`

Starts a Ganache instance in port 8545, deploys a test token, and starts a web server in port 8080.

Web server answers to following HTTP endpoints, read-only, for inspection purposes:

* GET /config
  * Returns the running server configuration
* GET /communities
  * Returns list of communities the server runs Operators for
* GET /communities/{communityAddress}/stats
  * Returns Operator stats.
* GET /communities/{communityAddress}/members
  * Returns list of members
* GET /communities/{communityAddress}/members/{memberAddress}
  * Returns individual member stats (such as balances and withdraw proofs)

All "writing" happens either through Ethereum contracts or the joinPartStream (see [streamrChannel.js](src/streamrChannel.js))

Start server script can be modified using the following environment variables:

| Variable | Notes |
| --- | --- |
|  ETHEREUM_SERVER | explicitly specify server address |
|  ETHEREUM_NETWORK | fallback alternative to the above, use ethers.js default servers |
|  OPERATOR_PRIVATE_KEY | private key of the operators, used for identifying which contracts we should be serving |
|  TOKEN_ADDRESS | $DATA token address |
|  STREAMR_WS_URL | Default: wss://www.streamr.com/api/v1/ws |
|  STREAMR_HTTP_URL | Default: https://www.streamr.com/api/v1 |
|  FINALITY_WAIT_SECONDS | Seconds to wait before assuming Ethereum won't re-org anymore |
|  GAS_PRICE_GWEI | Gas price for Ethereum transactions, defaults to network suggestion ([see ethers.js](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/blob/061b0eae1d4c570aedd9bee1971afa43fcdae1a6/tests/make-tests/make-contract-interface.js#L330)) |
|  STORE_DIR | CPS file storage location, defaults to `store` |
|  QUIET | Don't print to console.log |
|  WEBSERVER_PORT | HTTP API for /config and /communities endpoints |
|  SENTRY_TOKEN | DSN for sending Sentry messages |

# Debugging and developing

Use Node 12.16.1 and npm 6.14.1.

Run tests with one of the following:
* `npm run test` for all tests that should currently pass
* `npm run unit-tests` for just locally run unit tests of JS source files
* `npm run integration-tests` for end-to-end tests that run against [Docker environment](https://github.com/streamr-dev/streamr-docker-dev)
* `npm run system-tests` for end-to-end tests that run against Docker environment
* `npm run contract-tests` for smart contract tests

Note: STREAMR_WS_URL and STREAMR_HTTP_URL really should be set for integration-tests and system-tests, otherwise they'll contact production instances
